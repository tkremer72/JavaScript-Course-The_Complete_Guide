     In JavaScript every number is a float, or a number with decimal places, unlike other programming languages, JavaScript does not know special integer types. 

     Numbers are stored as 64 bit floating points in JavaScript.

     There is a maximum and minimum number.

     To get perfect results, multiply your number by 100 to make the result an integer.

     Infinity is the answer you get by dividing by zero.

# Regex 
     In most cases you will rarely need to use regex and if you do need to use it you can simply look up the regex expression you are looking for.
