# Typescript
     Before working with typescript, one must install the typescript compiler, we did this in school but I am going to do it again for my own sanity.  
     npm install typescript - install typescript locally - one time deal for each project you intend to use typescipt with.
     npm install -g typescript - install typescript globally to make available globally for use in all projects.
     npx tsc - compile typescript files - to compile typescript files, you should run the command tsc filename.extension.
