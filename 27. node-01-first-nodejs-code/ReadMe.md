# Working with Express and Node JS
     Before working with Express, I first need to make this an npm project.  I do this by running the command npm init and for this example I will use all of the defaults.
     The next step will be to install the express framework by running the command npm install --save express.  Also added a .gitignore file and put the node_modules folder inside of it to keep from pushing it to GitHub.
