# Modular JavaScript
     I started by modifying the css files, I can't do those bright colors even though I understand why the instructor did that.  They hurt my eyes, so the first thing I did after setting up the project was change the css files to be easier on my eyes.
     The instructor started with the events.js and events.html files included but had us delete them right off the bat, so I also removed the events.css file. 

     We need a development server, we would need to install node js latest version.  Then run the command to install the serve tool.  Run the command npm install -g serve.  Open the terminal from within the project and type in the command serve which will serve the index.html file
