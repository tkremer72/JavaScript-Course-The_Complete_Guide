     localStorage, sessionStorage - Simple key value store, Manage user preferences, or basic user data.  Can be cleared by the user and via JS.  Easy to use, quite versatile, bad for complex data.

     Cookies - Simple key value store with some configuration options, Manage user preferences or basic user data, can also be cleared by the user and via JS.  A bit clunky to use, quite versatile, sent to server, bad for complex data.

     indexedDB - Relatively sophisticated, client-side database.  Manage complex data your web app needs.  Can be cleared by the user and via JS.  Also a bit clunky to use, great for complex(non critical) data, good performance.
